\chapter*{Preface}

After graduating as Nuclear Engineer at Balseiro Institute in Argentina I started thinking in applying what I learned during my final year project on a code for simulating a nuclear reactor by state-of-the-art methods. My idea was to create a code that differentiate from the others so I focused my mind in three main properties:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Respect the GNU project philosophy.
 \item Capable of simulating all kind of nuclear reactors.
 \item Easy to use.
\end{itemize}
Having in mind to continue working in physical systems modeled by computer, I thought that I would have an example to show of a good way of working and designing. With this idea I started the code \emph{Fermi}, its name is in honor to Enrico Fermi, the first person to create a device capable of sustain a nuclear chain reaction.
